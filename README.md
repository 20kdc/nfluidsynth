# Before you continue!

This specific fork exists because I put up a NuGet package a while ago as part of an attempt to help fix SS14 MIDI issues on Linux.

Since the package is MIT it's not technically an issue that the package went without source for a little while but it's still not good practice so I'm correcting that by keeping this here.

If you want an actual version of this package please see upstream at https://github.com/atsushieno/nfluidsynth
